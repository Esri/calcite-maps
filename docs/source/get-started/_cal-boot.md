**Calcite** is a flexible design framework, created at ESRI, in which the map and data are the most important component of the user interface. All elements and interactions strengthen a geo-centered user experience.

**Calcite+Bootstrap** is a UI Kit built on the popular [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) CSS framework based on the Calcite design framework.

We have applied the robust set of patterns and utilities that are core to the Calcite framework to Calcite+Bootstrap. The purpose is to have designs be consistent, but also embrace the characteristics that make each medium unique.

Calcite+Bootstrap was built *for* developers who have experience working with Bootstrap markup and classes.
